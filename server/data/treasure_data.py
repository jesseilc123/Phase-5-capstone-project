beckoning_mannequin = Treasure(name="Beckoning Mannequin", location=6, series="Ancient Secrets", sparklium=250, description="While looking at this statue, I found myself smiling and petting its head for no discernible reason. It must possess a magical ability to captivate people and convince them to do its bidding. How can something so devious and manipulative be so cute?")

buddy_display = Treasure(name="Buddy Display", location=4, series="Ancient Secrets", sparklium=200, description="What mysterious and fluffy creatures. I can't find evidence of them in any of the existing creature databases, but there's something familiar about them. It's almost as if I've met them before... I guess I'll chalk it up to an ancient memory that's been imprinted on my genome.")

giants_fossil = Treasure(name="Giant's Fossil", location=2, series="Ancient Secrets", sparklium=450, description="Looking upon this warrior's calming visage is a peaceful way to spend an hour. The eyes seem to see through everything, as if their gaze is freeing you from the darkness of your mind. Perhaps I've stumbled upon the sacred key to life's greatest questions.")

lamp_of_inspiration = Treasure(name="Lamp of Inspiration", location=2, series="Ancient Secrets", sparklium=300, description="This lamp is the very definition of inspiring.

persistence_machine = Treasure(name="Persistence Machine", location=5, series="Ancient Secrets", sparklium=300, description="I've never been the type to give up. No matter how many times I fall, I'll always get back up again. At first I thought I could practice alongside this machine, but its stubby body reminds me too much of the president. One glance at it, and I lose all motivation to continue.")

crunchy_deluge = Treasure(name="Crunchy Deluge", location=6, series="Autumn Harvest", sparklium=90, description="Lots of juice in here, like having your mouth flooded in sweetness. Not much Piktamin U, but nutrition isn't everything. Sometimes you just want a natural disaster of flavor, you know?")

delectable_bouquet = Treasure(name="Delectable Bouquet", location=6, series="Autumn Harvest", sparklium=70, description="Crazy! We cut this open, and it's filled with tiny, white flowers, meaning it's not technically a fruit at all. Analysis also indicates that it won't be ripe very long before it starts to rot... I think I'll save this one for the captain.")

portable_sunset = Treasure(name="Portable Sunset", location=6, series="Autumn Harvest", sparklium=70, description="Look at the colors! It reminds me of the time I melted all my crayons and tried to combine them together into a supercrayon. I really thought that would work... Anyway, Alph doesn't like the smell of this fruit, but he doesn't have a sophisticated nose palate like I do.")

tremendous_sniffer = Treasure(name="Tremendous Sniffer", location=6, series="Autumn Harvest", sparklium=90, description="This specimen has a sweet flavor and a soft texture...kind of like my Auntie Bea. The shape reminds me of her nose, too. So elegant! So glamorous! She's the envy of the family with that nose... I miss my aunt. I want to go home.")

zest_bomb = Treasure(name="Zest Bomb", location=2, series="Autumn Harvest", sparklium=60, description="This one's sour but smells really nice. I wonder if the juice would work as a deodorant? I also wonder if we can spare a little for the experiment? Finally, I wonder if the captain would notice if I doused him in it while his back was turned?")

birdy_bed = Treasure(name="Birdy Bed", location=5, series="Bedtime", sparklium=60, description="Research has shown that sound waves created by a chirping bird are naturally comforting and induce sleep.Now, I don't have any strong preferences when it comes to bedding, but if this makes me feel like I'm sleeping on the forest floor, it could be worth a try.")

golden_vaulting_table = Treasure(name="Golden Vaulting Table", location=6, series="Dazzle", sparklium=1000, description="Apparently if you can jump over this, you'll be blessed with great wealth. I'm not the superstitious type, but I'm tempted to give it a try. I could use the extra cash. The only things standing in my way are my poor middle-aged hip joints...")

princess_pearl = Treasure(name="Princess Pearl", location=3, series="Dazzle", sparklium=150, description="Salvaging this treasure was a dangerous and difficult task. I found it deep in the bowels of a dank, predator-infested cavern. My only hope of surviving was to strategically use all five colors of Pikmin.")

sticky_jewel = Treasure(name="Sticky Jewel", location=2, series="Dazzle", sparklium=20, description="This gemstone is large but looks kind of cheap.

divine_balloon = Treasure(name="Divine Balloon", location=4, series="Toys of Giants", sparklium=40, description="Don't worry too much if it deflates. Simply pump more air into the top hole, and the original shape is restored. The material, though paper-thin, seems to repel water. Such an inspiring creation! Only the most advanced civilization could conceive of such a work of art. It's like a metaphor for both the fragility and durability of life itself.")

faux_fishy = Treasure(name="Faux Fishy", location=6, series="Toys of Giants", sparklium=300, description="I'm much more used to seeing fish painted in profile instead of from the top down. I suspect this is supposed to float on the water, but I'd be quite startled to encounter a fish like this under normal circumstances.")

priceless_bird = Treasure(name="Priceless Bird", location=4, series="Toys of Giants", sparklium=150, description="To have a charm that's solely devoted to financial luck comes off as vulgar and gives me an icky feeling.

unfloatable_boat = Treasure(name="Unfloatable Boat", location=2, series="Toys of Giants", sparklium=180, description="They say it's possible to float this Unfloatable Boat with the help of divine intervention.
